## How it works

A D latch, also known as a data latch or transparent latch, is a
fundamental building block in digital circuits, primarily used for
storing a single bit of binary data (0 or 1).

## How to test

To test, do the simulation and observe the characteristics of the
simulation results. Essentially, when Enable is low (0), the output
retains its previous state, regardless of the D input. However, when
Enable is high (1), the output directly reflects the D input.
